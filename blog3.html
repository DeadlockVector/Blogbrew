      <u><b><h2>How to actually give purpose to your 8th Grade Atlas book</h2></b></u>

      <p>To prop up the top of your bed when you have acid reflux. Carve out its center and fill it with the business cards of therapists, then give it as a gift to your friend’s libertarian-leaning teen-age son. You don’t want to tell your friend, but he spends all day on Reddit in r/LibertarianUncensored and someone needs to intervene.</p>
			<p>To leave out on your coffee table when your wealthy parents visit, so they know that, even though you’re a socialist, you’re not so much of a socialist that you don’t want to be included in the will. I mean, be reasonable. To make memes. For instance, you can photograph the line “wealth is the product of a man’s capacity to think” and then tweet it with the caption “LOL.” It should go viral, especially in today’s political climate.</p>
			<p>To keep on your bookshelf next to “Das Kapital” as proof that, despite your meme, you’re not taking a side in this class war. You’re Switzerland! You just wanted to go viral.As exercise equipment, to train for the increasingly likely scenario in which the proletariat rises up and you need to escape your city before the ruling class takes extreme measures to quell the outrage—you’ve had a target on your back ever since you made that meme. Not only is the book itself a handy weight but also Atlas’s pose on the cover provides a useful visual reference for how to exercise your quads. Soon, you’ll be lightning fast.</p>
			<p>To resell at the Strand for cash, earning enough for one tenth of a cup of coffee. Or, potentially, one one-thousandth of the price of a train ticket out of town when the bourgeoisie starts shooting. Fortunately, your parents Venmoed you money for the rest. Thank goodness you left your copy of “Atlas Shrugged” out when they came to visit!</p>
			<p>To wedge between yourself and the person next to you on this incredibly crowded train so that you have some semblance of personal space. If needed, you can even use it to thwack anybody who infringes on your small area. To keep you company when the train drops you off in the middle of nowhere and you realize that you’re on your own for the first time ever. It’s O.K., though! All you have to do is consider your own self-interest. After all, you once read that society functions best when we all do that. You can’t remember when you read that, but you feel like it was maybe in high school? Just hug the book tightly. It’s your new girlfriend.</p>
			<p>To use as kindling in this “Yellowjackets”-type situation you’re now in.Young women standing around a fire kindled with a copy of Atlas Shrugged.To stick under a lopsided table in your new dwelling, the one you fortuitously stumbled upon after weeks of wandering. (The Craigslist options in rural Canada were thin.). Footprints in the snow left from a person running to their cabin in the woods. To make memes about your new off-the-grid life. “I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.” Make sure that you caption this one with “LOL” again. You’re so lonely.</p>
